## Description 

The [`Vector`](vector) class is only used to help us 
determine the intersections between two cubic Bezier curves.

## Credits

This class is a port of work by [Kevin Lindsey](http://www.kevlindev.com/),
licensed under a BSD-3-clause license.

We have reached a gentlemen's agreement to dual-license this port (thanks Kevin!).

This way, we can include it here under a GPL license, yet it remains
available under the original BSD-3-clause license
for those who prefer that option.

You can find the BSD-3-clause licensed version of this code [here](https://github.com/freesewing/bsd).

## Typical use

The [`Vector`](vector) class is 100% internal, and used
only by the [`BezierToolbox`](beziertoolbox) class. 

You can simply forget about it. As a matter of fact, we're not even going
to document it any further.
