## Extending patterns

Patterns can extend (be based on) other patterns, which leads 
to the sort of pattern family tree shown below.

Designers who extend the base [`Pattern`](/class/patterns/core/pattern) class
need to implement everything themselves.

If you extend an existing pattern, a bunch of the work has been done 
for you, but you are limited in what you can change.

For example, you can extend the SimonShirt pattern to created a specific
shirt style. But you can't (or shouldn't) turn it into trousers.
