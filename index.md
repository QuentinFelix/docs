            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p class="lead">Freesewing is an open source platform for made-to-measure sewing patterns</p>
            <p>This documentation site currently holds documentation for the freesewing core platform.
            Which means that it is most relevant to developers and designers.</p>
            <p>Documentation for makers &mdash; how to sew up our patterns and all that &mdash; is still hosted on 
            <a href="https://makemypattern.com/">makemypattern.com</a>,
            the predecessor of this site.</p>
            <blockquote class="mt-4">
                <h5>Don't be shy to suggest changes</h5>
                <p>Freesewing is open source, and so is our documentation. If you see something that needs improvement,
                you can click the <b>Improve this page</b> button at the very bottom of every page.</p>
