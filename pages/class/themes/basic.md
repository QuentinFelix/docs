## Description 

The [`Basic`](basic) theme merely extends the abstract [`Theme`](theme) class.
It does not provide any extra methods or code, but it does come
with its own template directory, including:

- footer-comments
- header-comments
- style.css
- svg-attributes
- svg-defs

The basic theme is the standard freesewing theme, and generates basic SVG output.
